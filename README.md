The PrizePool Lottery smart contract is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the blockchain. It facilitates a lottery system where participants can purchase PrizePool Tokens (PPL) and hold them to be eligible for three different types of lotteries: bi-weekly, semi-quarterly, and annual. The smart contract automatically distributes a portion of transaction fees to these prize pools, which are then awarded to randomly selected eligible participants based on their token holdings. Participants can connect their wallets using MetaMask to interact with the contract, check their eligibility, view draw statistics, and see the winners of the last draw.
